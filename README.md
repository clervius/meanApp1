JC MEAN Stack Application Tutorial
==================================
Second time trying full Mean Stack with Authentication
------------------------------------------------------

This was built using a combination of tutorials from Pluralsight, scotch.io, and tutorialspoint

links:
    * [Pluralsight](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/building-angularjs-nodejs-apps-mean/table-of-contents)
    * [Scotch.io](https://scotch.io/tutorials/single-page-apps-with-angularjs-routing-and-templating)
    * [tutorialspoint](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/angularjs/index.htm)

Definitely will need an understanding of node.js, Mongo, and express.js before jumping in.
